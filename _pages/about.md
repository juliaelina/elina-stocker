Hi! Happy to find you here. My name is Julia Elina Stocker and I'm a PhD student at the University of Marburg. Since Mai 2024, I am part of the [Lab for Multimodal Neuroimaging (LMN)](https://lmn-marburg.de/). The lab is located at the Clinic of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy. Its main focus is to try to understand face processing networks of the brain. My region of interst lies in the methodologies and processing stategies around MRI data. With the help of computational models, I want to try to understand brain processes and network dynamics. 

During my PhD I want to delve deeper into how brain networks contribute to lateralized processes, such as face perception. I wish to get a better understanding of hemispheric differences and why these vary across people. To do so, I will use a variety of different analysis stategies, such as Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), Multi-variate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and cross-modal data fusion.
