The first time I encountered DCM, Dynamic Causal Modelling, was in a fMRI-methods class. The lecturer (Prof. Jansen) did a great job in explaining the gist of it. That included how it could be used to model brain networks and obtain their directed connectivity. For me this sounded very familiar to previous classes on computational neurosciene where I picked up on something that was called control theory. Thus the idea that dynamical systems could be characterized by its inputs and how these change the system wasn't very new to me. Yet, I found DCM very intriguing, enough so to write my master thesis using this method. Back then my understanding of DCM wasn't very profound, I got the basic concept, could apply it to the data but was lost, when facing words like "variational bayes" or "kullback-leibler divergence". Today, I have a better idea of what DCM is about. Still, I am learning, more than once, what DCM is made of and I'm far from full comprehension. Here, I will proceed with my journey to understaing DCM, without claiming this understanding to be true.
